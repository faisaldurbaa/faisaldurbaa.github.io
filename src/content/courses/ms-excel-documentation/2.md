### Making Decisions with the IF Function

One of Excel's most powerful features is its ability to perform different actions based on whether a condition is met. The core of this is the `IF` function.

**Syntax:** `=IF(logical_test, [value_if_true], [value_if_false])`

  * **logical\_test:** Any value or expression that can be evaluated to TRUE or FALSE. (e.g., `A2 > 10`, `B2 = "Completed"`)
  * **value\_if\_true:** The value that is returned if the logical test is TRUE.
  * **value\_if\_false:** The value that is returned if the logical test is FALSE.

**Example:** Imagine you want to assign "Pass" or "Fail" based on a score in cell A2. If the passing score is 60, the formula would be:

```plaintext
=IF(A2>=60, "Pass", "Fail")
```

### Handling Multiple Conditions

What if you have more than two outcomes?

**1. Nested IF Statements (The Old Way)**
You can place an `IF` function inside another `IF` function. For example, to assign grades:

```plaintext
=IF(A2>=90, "A", IF(A2>=80, "B", IF(A2>=70, "C", "D")))
```

While this works, it can become very confusing to read and edit.

**2. The IFS Function (The Modern Way)**
A much cleaner solution for multiple criteria is the `IFS` function.

**Syntax:** `=IFS([logical_test1, value_if_true1], [logical_test2, value_if_true2], ...)`

```plaintext
=IFS(A2>=90, "A", A2>=80, "B", A2>=70, "C", A2<70, "D")
```

Excel checks each condition in order and stops at the first one that is TRUE.

### Combining Criteria with AND and OR

Sometimes your decision depends on more than one condition at the same time.

  * **`AND` Function:** Returns TRUE only if **all** of its arguments are TRUE.
  * **`OR` Function:** Returns TRUE if **any** of its arguments are TRUE.

You typically use these inside the `logical_test` part of an `IF` function.

**Example with `AND`**: A bonus is given only if an employee is "Full Time" (cell C2) AND their years of service (cell G2) are 5 or more.

```plaintext
=IF(AND(C2="Full Time", G2>=5), "Eligible for Bonus", "Not Eligible")
```

**Example with `OR`**: A person gets a special status if they are a "Mother" (cell B2) OR have more than 5 children (cell C2).

```plaintext
=IF(OR(B2="Mother", C2>5), "Deserves", "Doesn't Deserve")
```

### Working with Text Data

**1. Combining Text (Concatenation)**
You can merge text from multiple cells using the `&` symbol or the `CONCATENATE` function. The `&` symbol is generally quicker.

**Example:** To combine a first name in A2 and a last name in B2 with a space in between:

```plaintext
=A2 & " " & B2
```

This would produce a result like "John Smith".

**2. Cleaning Up Text with `TRIM`**
Often, when you import data, you get extra, unwanted spaces. The `TRIM` function removes leading/trailing spaces and reduces multiple spaces between words to a single space.

**Syntax:** `=TRIM(text)`

```plaintext
=TRIM(A2)
```

**3. Splitting Text with Text to Columns**
If you have a column with combined data (like "Firstname Lastname"), you can easily split it into separate columns.

1.  Select the column of data you want to split.
2.  Go to the **Data** tab and click **Text to Columns**.
3.  Choose **Delimited** if your text is separated by a character like a comma, space, or tab.
4.  Follow the steps to specify the delimiter and the destination for your new columns.

### Enforcing Rules with Data Validation

Data Validation allows you to control what kind of data can be entered into a cell. This is critical for preventing errors.

You can find it under **Data \> Data Tools \> Data Validation**.

**Common Uses:**

  * **Restricting to Numbers:** Allow only whole numbers or decimals.
  * **Creating a Dropdown List:** This is one of the most popular uses. Instead of letting users type, you can give them a list of valid options to choose from.

**To create a dropdown list:**

1.  Select the cell(s) where you want the list.
2.  Go to **Data Validation**.
3.  In the **Settings** tab, under **Allow**, choose **List**.
4.  In the **Source** box, you can either type your list items separated by commas (e.g., `Yes,No,Maybe`) or select a range of cells that contains your list.
5.  Click OK.
