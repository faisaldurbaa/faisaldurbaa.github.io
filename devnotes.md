# Development Notes

## Remaining Features

### Module-1:
RSS Feed Integration: We completely removed the @astrojs/rss integration from astro.config.mjs. It was causing the dev server to fail.
When it will be done: We will install and configure it in Module 4, which is the correct time since we will have the blog content for it to process.
